Hi there 👋, I'm [Ali Mohammadjafari](https://github.com/AliMohammadjafari)

--------------------------------------------

 I'm a PhD Student in Computer Science at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

🧠 My research focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs) and their application in natural language processing, specifically in the domain of text-to-SQL translation.

📊 I'm developing a chat agent powered by GPT-4, designed to interact with a geo-spatial database of gas stations in Louisiana. My goal is to enhance the agent's ability to generate accurate SQL queries from natural language inputs, improving metrics like Exact Match Accuracy (EX).

🔍 I'm particularly interested in the challenges and solutions related to integrating LLMs with domain-specific databases, and I'm working on innovative techniques to boost the precision and reliability of these systems.

 My work also delves into the optimization of query generation processes to handle complex spatial data efficiently, ensuring that the generated SQL queries are both correct and performant.

💬 I'd love to discuss my research and any collaborations! Feel free to ask me about my work or any related topics in machine learning and natural language processing.
